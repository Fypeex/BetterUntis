### Current Versions
```
1.0.0 - Basic App without any Features
```
### Background

The main idea of this project is to create a new, hopefully better and more controllable version of the Mobile Webuntis App. It should include for example premium features like
normal App has. Next to that, we want to include a Push notification System.

Originally the developers of this Project were Felix Jungbluth and Julian Weninger. However, Julian wasnt comfortable with first, Android studio and then React Native. Therefore
he decided to do an own project. Michael is now responsible for the styling while Felix is responsible for the construction of the different components, the App and displaying
the data.

To get the necessary Data, we use the provided JSON API from Webunits. Next to that we use different public webuntis website APIs which are not listed in the API documentation
sent to us.
We target to grab the Data in intervals (5mins?) as well as manually and then compare them to the old, stored data. If they differciate, we notify the user. Next to that, the app
will be able to render the timetable and the user is able to customize it.
In theory, this app will work with every school however, we can only test it with our RFGS accounts.

*Optional:*
Every student can contribute ideas/features which will then be implemented
